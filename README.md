# HolyTS - Drop in Replacement for Macros in other Languages.
HolyTypeScript written to write Source Code for other Holy Languages. Implements a TS => HolyC like Compiler. Gets mainly used as drop in replacement for Macros in other languages.

It is a omage to Terry and the message that he spread to the world even if he got not right understood which frustrated him maybe as much as it does me but i am a stronger person. Anyway This allows you to Write HolyC like C Code or any other Code but i use it Mainly for C and C++

HolyTS implements many concepts of other popular projects but in a opinionated way that i identified as beeing the most Easy to learn teach and use without additional quirks a main reason why this exists is that it is to much overhead to use other solutions that exist as you need to learn all the quirks. In fact it implements the Stealify Lang but renamed to HolyTS as omage and it also adds Typescript like Implementation concepts maybe it will at some point be a drop in replacement for typescripts nodejs implementation.
